    <h2>The Grand Duke</h2>
    <h3>ACT II -Entrance Hall of the Grand Ducal Palace. </h3>
    <p> Enter a procession of the members of the theatrical company <p>(now
        dressed in the costumes of Troilus and Cressida)</p>, carrying
        garlands, playing on pipes, citharae, and cymbals, and
        heralding the return of LUDWIG and JULIA from the marriage
        ceremony, which has just taken place.
        <h4>JULIA. </h4> <p>And now that everybody has gone, and we're happily
        and comfortably married, I want to have a few words with my
        new-born husband.</p>
        <h4>LUD.(aside)</h4>   <p>Yes, I expect you'll often have a few words
        with your new-born husband!  (Aloud.)  Well, what is it?</p>
        <h4>JULIA.</h4>  <p>Why, I've been thinking that as you and I have to
        play our parts for life, it is most essential that we should come
        to a definite understanding as to how they shall be rendered.
        Now, I've been considering how I can make the most of the Grand
        Duchess.</p>
        <h4>LUD.</h4><p>Have you?  Well, if you'll take my advice, you'll
        make a very fine part of it.</p>  
        <h4>JULIA.</h4>  <p>Why, that's quite my idea.</p>
        <h4>LUD.</h4><p>  I shouldn't make it one of your hoity-toity vixenish
        viragoes.</p>
        <h4>JULIA.</h4> <p> You think not?</p>
        <h4>LUD.</h4>  <p>Oh, I'm quite clear about that.  I should make her a
        tender, gentle, submissive, affectionate (but not too
        affectionate) child-wife—timidly anxious to coil herself into
        her husband's heart, but kept in check by an awestruck reverence
        for his exalted intellectual qualities and his majestic personal
        appearance.</p> 
        <p>  SONG—LUDWIG.

            By the mystic regulation
            Of our dark Association,
            Ere you open conversation
                  With another kindred soul,
                  You must eat a sausage-roll! (Producing one.)</p>

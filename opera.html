    <h3>ACT II -Entrance Hall of the Grand Ducal Palace. </h3>
    <p>        JULIA.  And now that everybody has gone, and we're happily
        and comfortably married, I want to have a few words with my
        new-born husband.
              LUD. (aside).  Yes, I expect you'll often have a few words
        with your new-born husband!  (Aloud.)  Well, what is it?
              JULIA.  Why, I've been thinking that as you and I have to
        play our parts for life, it is most essential that we should come
        to a definite understanding as to how they shall be rendered.
        Now, I've been considering how I can make the most of the Grand
        Duchess.
              LUD.  Have you?  Well, if you'll take my advice, you'll
        make
        a very fine part of it.
              JULIA.  Why, that's quite my idea.
              LUD.  I shouldn't make it one of your hoity-toity vixenish
        viragoes.
              JULIA.  You think not?
      </p>

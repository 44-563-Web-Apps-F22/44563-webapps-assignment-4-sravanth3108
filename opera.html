    <h2>The Grand Duke</h2>
    <h3>ACT II -Entrance Hall of the Grand Ducal Palace. </h3>
    <p> It is intended to express inconsolable grief for the decease of the
        late Duke and ebullient joy at the accession of his successor.  I
        am his successor.  Permit me to present you to my Grand Duchess.
        (Indicating JULIA.)
              BAR.  Your Grand Duchess?  Oh, your Highness!  (Curtseying
        profoundly.)
              JULIA (sneering at her).  Old frump!
              BAR.  Humph!  A recent creation, probably?
              LUD.  We were married only half an hour ago.
              BAR.  Exactly. I thought she seemed new to the position.
              JULIA.  Ma'am, I don't know who you are, but I flatter
        myself I can do justice to any part on the very shortest notice.
              BAR.  My dear, under the circumstances you are doing
        admirablyâ€”and you'll improve with practice.  It's so difficult
        to be a lady when one isn't born to it.
              JULIA (in a rage, to LUDWIG).  Am I to stand this?  Am I
        not
        to be allowed to pull her to pieces?
      
      </p>

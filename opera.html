        dressed in the costumes of Troilus and Cressida)</div><p class ="description"> carrying
        garlands, playing on pipes, citharae, and cymbals, and

        ceremony, which has just taken place.</p>
        <h4 class="julia">JULIA. </h4> <p class = "speech">And now that everybody has gone, and we're happily
        and comfortably married, I want to have a few words with my
        new-born husband.</p>
        <h4 class ="lud">LUD.</h4> <p class ="direction">(aside)</p>   <p class = "speech">Yes, I expect you'll often have a few words
        with your new-born husband!  (Aloud.)  Well, what is it?</p>
        <h4 class="julia">JULIA.</h4>  <p class = "speech">Why, I've been thinking that as you and I have to
        play our parts for life, it is most essential that we should come
        to a definite understanding as to how they shall be rendered.
        Now, I've been considering how I can make the most of the Grand
        Duchess.</p>
        <h4 class="lud">LUD.</h4><p class = "speech">Have you?  Well, if you'll take my advice, you'll
        make a very fine part of it.</p>  
        <h4 class="julia">JULIA.</h4>  <p class = "speech">Why, that's quite my idea.</p>
        <h4 class="lud">LUD.</h4><p class = "speech">  I shouldn't make it one of your hoity-toity vixenish
        viragoes.</p>
        <h4 class="julia">JULIA.</h4> <p class = "speech"> You think not?</p>
        <h4 class="lud">LUD.</h4>  <p class = "speech">Oh, I'm quite clear about that.  I should make her a
        tender, gentle, submissive, affectionate </p> <p class ="direction">(but not too
        affectionate)</p> <p class = "speech" >child-wife—timidly anxious to coil herself into
        her husband's heart, but kept in check by an awestruck reverence
        for his exalted intellectual qualities and his majestic personal
        appearance.</p>
